                    The team with the most points wins the game

                    <strong>MATERIAL :</strong>

                    40 cards (10 cards per category and 4 category)

                    A smartphone with stopwatch access

                    A game is played in 3 rounds. During its turn, a team has 30 seconds to guess the maximum of
                    words

                    <strong>Preparation of the game :</strong>

                    For a game, take 1 pile of 10 cards with a 1 soft skills topics, or all piles together, that is
                    40 cards

                    If the group has chosen only one pile, the whole game will be played with this colour

                    A player starts, he is the speaker.

                    Different piles of cards:

                    Orange : team spirit

                    Red : leadership

                    Green : organization

                    Purple : communication and active listening

                    The course of a game

                    Part one game has 3 rounds. Each team plays in turn. A player start the timer around and says
                    “Here we go”. The speaker has 30 sec to guess the maximum of words defining the soft skills
                    chosen for his team.

                    During the first set, the speaker speaks freely.

                    During the 2nd, he says only a word to make guess

                    During the 3rd, he can’t speak, he has to use mimes

                    1) First round

                    The player can speak freely but must respect certain rules like. They do not say of the parts
                    or diminutives and first names indicated on the card, do not list letters of the alphabet, do
                    not use direct traduction and if the speaker makes a mistake his turn ends. When the team
                    guessed the word, the speaker gives his team the card face up -> he turns the next card and
                    tries to guess it.

                    As soon as the time is up, the turn of this team stops and no more proposals are accepted, the
                    card in progress is handed over under the draw. All guessed cards are kept in the team. Next
                    team. The members of the other teams are speakers one after the other. Continue until the pick
                    is exhausted.

                    Calculation of points :

                    When the pickaxe is exhausted, the round is finished. Each team counts the number of cards they
                    have guessed. Points are scored. The team with the most points wins the round.

                    2) Second round

                    This time, the speaker’s team can only give a proposal of 1 word per card with the same
                    prohibitions as first round. If the team has found, the speaker puts the card face up and turns
                    the next card over. In case of error the speaker can pass cards. The calculation is identical
                    to the 1st round. The next speaker begins the 3rd round.

                    3) Third Round

                    Same as the previous ones, but the speaker is no longer allowed to speak, he can only mimic.
                    Forbidden to hum songs.
